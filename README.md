## Built With

- `React` : version 18.2.0
- `Gatsby` : version 5.3.2
- `Sass` : version 1.57.1
- `Framer-motion` : version 8.0.1

## Features

- The website isn't used any CSS libraries such as MUI and Tailwind intentionally to try to prove my well-trained CSS skills. Using Sass helped make the website flexible so I also put animation for interacting with the user more dynamically.
  I put stylings by CSS modules and also designed with Figma from scratch.

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run develop` to start running the app
